Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings.
The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single
count and character.
For example, 
the string 
-->   "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".
-->   "AAAAAAABBBBBBDDDDCCCCCDDDABCD" encoded as  "A7B6D4C5D3A1B1C1D1"
