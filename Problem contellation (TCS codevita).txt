Constellation

Problem Description

Three characters { #, *, . } represents a constellation of stars and galaxies in space. Each galaxy is demarcated by # characters. There can be one or many stars in a given galaxy. Stars can only be in shape of vowels { A, E, I, O, U } . A collection of * in the shape of the vowels is a star. A star is contained in a 3x3 block. Stars cannot be overlapping. The dot(.) character denotes empty space.

Given 3xN matrix comprising of { #, *, . } character, find the galaxy and stars within them.

Note: Please pay attention to how vowel A is denoted in a 3x3 block in the examples section below.

Constraints

3 <= N <= 10^5

Input

Input consists of single integer N denoting number of columns.

Output

Output contains vowels (stars) in order of their occurrence within the given galaxy. Galaxy itself is represented by # character.

Output

U#O#I#EA

Explanation

As it can be seen that the stars make the image of the alphabets U, O, I, E and A respectively.
