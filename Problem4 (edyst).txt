Nobita has a specific medicine to solve this problem. He tried to say the name of the medicine, but his sentences are jumbled beyond imagination.

Here is how you can help him:

His sentence is in the form of a very long word. mymedicinesarerighthere
You need to break this word down in the following way: m, ym ,edi ,cine ,sarer ,ighthe, re
Then take the first and last characters of the sub-words as long as the sub-word is longer than the previous sub-word: m, ym, ei, ce, sr, ie. Notice we don't touch re because it is shorter than the previous sub-word
The words on joining gives the name of Nobita's medicines: mymeicesrie
Input Format
