A Chakravyuha is a wheel-like formation. Pictorially it is depicted as below

enter image description here

A Chakravyuha has a very well-defined co-ordinate system. Each point on the co-ordinate system is manned by a certain unit of the army. The Commander-In-Chief is always located at the center of the army to better co-ordinate his forces. The only way to crack the Chakravyuha is to defeat the units in sequential order.

A Sequential order of units differs structurally based on the radius of the Chakra. The radius can be thought of as length or breadth of the matrix depicted above. The structure i.e. placement of units in sequential order is as shown below

1	2	3	4	5

16	17	18	19	6	

15	24	25	20	7

14	23	22	21	8

13	12	11	10	9
The entry point of the Chakravyuha is always at the (0,0) co-ordinate of the matrix above. This is where the 1st army unit guards. From (0,0) i.e. 1st unit Abhimanyu has to march towards the center at (2,2) where the 25th i.e. the last of the enemy army unit guards. Remember that he has to proceed by destroying the units in sequential fashion. After destroying the first unit, Abhimanyu gets a power point. Thereafter, he gets one after destroying army units which are multiples of 11. You should also be a in a position to tell Yudhisthir Maharaj the location at which Abhimanyu collected his power points.
