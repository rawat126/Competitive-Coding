Suppandi is trying to take part in the local village math quiz. In the first round, he is asked about shapes and areas. Suppandi, is confused, he was never any good at math. And also, he is bad at remembering the names of shapes. Instead, you will be helping him calculate the area of shapes.

When he says rectangle he is actually referring to a square.  
When he says square, he is actually referring to a triangle.
When he says triangle he is referring to a rectangle
And when he is confused, he just says something random. At this point, all you can do is say 0.
Help Suppandi by printing the correct answer in an integer.
